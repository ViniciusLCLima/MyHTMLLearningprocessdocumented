		<h1 id="textlessons">Text</h1>
		<h2>Headings</h2>
		<p>Headings are made by putting an H letter at the start of a tag, putting the correspondent number of the type of heading you want, then putting the heading content and then closing it with its closing tag. </p>
		<h1> This an H1, it is the greater of the h# elements </h1>
		<h2> This is an H2, it is smaller than the h1. According to the book, can be used as a sub-topic of the h1</h1>
		<h3> This is an h3, designed to be a sub-topic of the h2, and so on with h4, h5 and 6</h3>
		<h2>White spaces</h2>
		<p>If I put 2 					or more spaces or break a line in a content, 
		the browser is going to treat it like just one space, like I did just now.</p>
		<h2>Paragraphs</h2>
		<p>Paragraphs are made by an opening tag with a "P" letter after its left angle bracket, putting the content of the paragraph you want to be shown on your page, and then putting a closing tag with another "P" Letter after its forward slash.</p>
		<h2>Bold and Italic</h2>
		<p>The <b>bold</b> element is made by putting a content between an openning tag and a closing tag, with the first characters of those being a <i>"b"</i>, like this: &lt;b&gt;. The <i>Italic</i> element is made the same way, but instead of putting a <i>"b"</i>, we put an <i>"i"</i> into it.</p>
		<p>The <b>bold</b> element usually contains and emphasizes keywords of a text, while the <i>italic</i> represents words that would be spoken in different manners from surrounding text if it was spoken out loud.</p>
		<h2>Superscript and subscript</h2>
		<p>Superscript is made by putting content between a closing tag and an opening tag, with the first characters of those being "sup", subscript is made the same way, but the first characters of its tags are "sub".</p> 
		<p>The superscript element contains superscript characters(or "caracteres superíndice" in portuguese) and is most commonly used to express suffixes of dates, such as 4<sup>th</sup>, or for mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power(eg:2<sup>2</sup>), while the subscript element contains subscript characters(or "caracteres sub-índice")</p>
		<H2>Line breaks</h2>
		<p>It's possible to add line breaks into a document without having to create another paragraph<br /> like I did just now, by adding the tag "&lt;br /&gt" to the code. <br> The "&lt;br&gt" tag does the same thing</p>
		<h2>Horizontal Rules</h2>
		<p>A horizontal rule is an empty element, it's made of a left angle bracket, the letters "HR", a space and a forward slash, "&lt;HR /&gt". It's used to break different sections of a web page. Like this</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Strong and emphasis</h2>
		<p> The strong element is used to indicate that a piece of text has great importance in it. Eg: "<strong>Advice:</strong> don't close the window without saving your changes". It is made by an opening tag, a closing tag, with its first characters being "strong", and a content between them. The Emphasis element is made the same way, but the first characters of the tags are "em", it is used to indicate where the <em>emphasis</em> should be placed in a group of words, like this, and, by default, it will be shown in the browser in italic.</p>
  		<h2>Quotations and the use of the cite attribute in it</h2>
		<p> There are two elements for quotations, the Blockquote and the &lt;q&gt. </p>
		<p>The &lt;blockquote&gt element is used for longer quotes, that take up an entire paragraph. It is made of an opening tag, a closing tag, with its first characters being a "blockquote" and a content.</p>
		<blockquote cite="Duckett, J. (2011). HTML e CSS: design and build websites. J. Wiley & Sons">
			<p>Browsers tend to indent the contents of the &lt;blockquote&gt element, however you should not use this element just to indent a piece of text — rather you should achieve this effect using CSS.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The &lt;q&gt element is made the same way, but the first characters of the tags will be just "q". It <q cite="www.globo.com"> is used for shorter quotes</q> that takes place within a paragraph.</p>
		<p>There's also the possibility of using the cite attribute to indicate the source of the quotation, which was made in the examples above, it will not be shown anywhere on the screen though.</p>
		<h2>Abreviation and the use of the title atribute with it</h2>
		<p>The Abbreviation element is made of an opening tag, a closing tag, with its first characters being "abbr", and a content between the tags:&lt;abbr&gt. It Tells the browser that content is an abbreviation. Eg:<abbr>HTML</abbr></p>
		<p>The title attribute can be used with the Abbreviation element to tell the abbreviation's full term. Like: <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. The full term will be highlighted if we pass the mouse over that abbreviation in the browser.</p>
		<h2>Ins and Del</h2>
		<p>The Ins element is made of an opening tag, a closing tag, with its first characters being "ins", and a content between them. It is used to indicate the insertion of a content on the page. It will be shown with an underline in it by the browser.</p>
		<p>The Del element is made the same way, with the exception that the first characters of its tags will be "del". It is used to indicate the deletion of a content from the document. It usually will appear with a line on the topside of its letters in the browser</p>
		<p>Eg: "Jon is a <del>good</del> <ins>bad</ins> lawyer."</p>
		<h2>&lt;s&gt;</h2>
		<p>The &lt;s&gt; element is made of an opening tag, a closing tag, with its first characters being an "s", and a content between them. It is used to indicate that a content is no longer relevant or is incorrect. It will appear in the browser with a line through its center.</p>
		<p>E.g., Computer<br> 
			was <s>700$</s><br>
			now 500$</p>

		<h2>Example 1: practicing</h2>
		<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
		<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
		<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <cite>Nature, New Scientist</cite>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well-thumbed copy of <cite>On the road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
		<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that "Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do". Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the Ilama <abbr>DNA</abbr> to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
		<hr />
		
		<h1 id="listslessons">Lists</h1>
		<p>You can make three types of lists:
			<ul>
				<li>The unordered list, which is a list that is not ordered, it will be shown in the browser indented, with a bullet point. It is made by:</li>
				<ol>
					<li> putting an opening tag with its first characters being "ul"</li>
					<li>putting list items between opening and closing tags with their first characters being "li"</li>
					<li>putting its closing tag, whose first characters should be "ul" too</li>
				</ol>
				<li>The ordered list, which is a list that is ordered and that is going to be shown indented and numbered in the browser.</li>
				<li>The definition List, which is a list of terms and their definitions(there can be more than one definition for each term, and more than one term for a definition too). Like:
				<dl>
				<dt>Roses</dt>
				<dd>A type of flower</dd>
				<dt>Wednesday</dt>
				<dd>The 4<sup>th</sup> day of the week</dd>
				</dl></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p> There can also be a nested list, which is a list inside another list. To do it, just put a list inside an &lt;li&gt element, as we did above.</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Example 2: practicing</h2>
		<H1>Scrambled eggs</h1>
		<p>Eggs are one of my favorite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>2 eggs</li>
			<li>1tbs butter</li>
			<li>2tbs butter</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Method</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat</li>
			<li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
			<li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs</li>
			<li>Using spatula fold eggs from edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if you are making an omelet)</li>
			<li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat(it will continue to cook on the plate until served)</li>
		</ol>
		<hr />
		<h1 id="linkslessons">Links</h1>
		<h2>Types of links</h2>
		<p>There are five different types of links, links to other websites, links to other pages inside the same website where the link is, links to a part of a page, links that open a new window and links that open an email program in our system and create a new email with an email address, for us to send.</p>
		<h2>Links to other websites</h2>
		<p>To create a link to another website, you have to create an &lt;a&gt element, which is made of an opening tag, a closing tag, with its first characters being an "a" letter, and a content. To specify where that link is going to get us, we have to put an HREF attribute inside the opening tag of the element, its value should be the absolute URL(which is the address we type in our browser to get into that website) of that site. The &lt;a&gt element is going to be shown blue and with an underline in the browser.</p>
		<p>E.g.,<a href=https://google.com> Get to google by clicking here!</a></p>
		<h2>Links to pages on the same website</h2>
		<p>To make links to other pages on the same website, the process is the same as creating a link to another website, except that now we're going to use a relative URL to do it.</p>
		<p>A relative URL is a short way of telling our browser how to get to the page or file we want from the page we are currently in. If the file we want to get to is inside the same folder of the file we're currently in just put the name of that file. If it's in our folder's child folder, we must put the name of that folder, followed by a forward slash and then, the file name. If it is inside a grandchild folder we just need to put the name of the child folder, a forward slash, the name of the grandchild folder, and then the file name, and so on. Eg:(childfoldername/grandchildfoldername/filename)If we want a URL for files in a parent folder, we must start it with two dats, a forward slash and then the name of the file, if we want a URL for files from our grandparent folder, we must again start it with two dots and a forward slash, but this time we're going two put it another time(eg:../../filename).</p>
		<p>Examples
			<ul>
				<li><a href="example_page.html">Go to the example page in this folder!</a></li>
				<li><a href="main_folder_s_child_folder/example_page.html">Go to the example page in the child folder!</a></li>
				<li><a href="../example_page.html">Go to the example page in our parent folder!</a></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Links to address an email to someone</h2>
		<p>To do it we got to make an &lt;a&gt element and add an href atribute to its opening tag with the value "mailto:emailaddress". Like:<a href="mailto:someone@mail.com"> click here to send an email to someone!</a></p>
		<h2>Links that open in a new window</h2>
		<p>To make a link open in a new window, we have to add a target attribute to the opening tag of its &lt;a&gt element, with its value being "_blank".</p>
		<p>E.g., <a href=https://google.com target="_blank">Click to go to google! (opens in a new window)</a></p>
		<h2>Links to other parts in the same webpage</h2>
		<p>To do it, the first thing we got to do is to add an ID attribute to every element we want a link to send us to. The value of the ID attribute must start with an underscore or a letter(not any other type of character) and two different elements should not have the same ID attribute values. Like:id="element1"</p>
		<p>After that, we just need to create an &lt;a&gt element with an href attribute, with its value starting with a # followed by the ID attribute value of the element we want that link to send us.</p>

			<li><a href="#listslessons">List lessons</a></li>
			<li><a href="#linkslessons">Links lessons</a></p></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Links to specific parts of another web page</h2>
		<p>To do it, we have to add to the address of that page a # followed by the id value of the element we want that link to send us, considering that element has an id value. Like: &lt;a hreg="site.com#bottom"&gt;.</p>
		<p>That's what I did just here, creating a link to the bottom of one of the example pages:<br />
		<a href="main_folder_s_child_folder/example_page.html#bottomofthepage">Get to the bottom of the Example page here!!!</a></p>

		<h1>Images</h1>
		<h2>How to add it</h2>
		<p>To add images, we got to make an image embed element, it's made just of one tag with its first characters being "img", and its last characters are a space and a forward slash. To tell the browser where is the image, we use the attribute src, with its value being a URL. It is also advisable to use an alt attribute to describe with accuracy what is in that image, this is going to be used by screen readers(for people with visual impairments) and search engines. You can also add the title attribute to give more information about it, and the width and height to define its size in pixels, these can be used for the browser to take the image size into account when rendering the page. Like:&lt;img src="URL" alt="image description" width="100" height="100" /&gt;</p>
		<p>Eg:<br />
		<img src="images/image.png" alt="Representation of an image" height="120" width="120" /></p>
		<h2>The use of the align attribute with it(old code)</h2>
		<img src="images/image.png" alt="Representation of an image" height="120" width="120" align="left"/>
		<p>The align attribute was usually used before HTML5 to indicate how the surrounding elements of an image should align with it, even though, according to the book, it's not recommended anymore. The way it works is, if we put a horizontal value in it(left or right), the image is going to be aligned at that side of the block element(which is an element that starts in a new line) it could be in, and any other thing that could fit along its length. Like we did here.</p>
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<p><img src="images/image.png" alt="Representation of an image" height="120" width="120" align="middle"/>If we put a vertical value in it on the other hand(middle, top or bottom), it will only align the first line of the block element it's in. Like here.</p>
		<h2>Associating an image with a caption</h2>
		<p>It is also possible to associate an image with a caption, to do this we got to create a &lt;figure&gt element, which is made of an opening tag, a closing tag and elements inside it, with the first characters of the tags being "figure". The elements inside must be one or more image embed elements, which is going to be the image/images, and a &lt;figcaption element&gt;, which is going to be the caption and which is made of an opening tag, a closing tag and a content, with the first characters of the tags being "figcaption".</p>
		<p>Like:
			<figure>
				<img src="images/image.png" alt="representation of an image" height="120" width="120" />
				<figcaption>This caption is associated with the image above using the &lt;figure&gt; element</figcaption>
			</figure>
		</p>

		<img src="images/Vinicius_s Recipes/Vinicius_s Recipes.png" alt="A logo with the words &quotVinicius's recipes&quot and a cookie on its right" width="560" height="111"/>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/Vinicius_s Recipes/Main image.jpg" alt="a chocolate brownie" title="The secret is to warm the oven before cooking it." width="483" height="321"/>
			<figcaption>This recipe for brownies is so simple and delectable!</figcaption>
