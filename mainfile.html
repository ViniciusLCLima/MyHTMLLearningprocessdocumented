		<h1>Text</h1>
		<h2>Headings</h2>
		<p>Headings are made by putting an H letter at the start of a tag, putting the correspondent number of the type of heading you want, then putting the heading content and then closing it with its closing tag. </p>
		<h1> This an H1, it is the greater of the h# elements </h1>
		<h2> This is an H2, it is smaller than the h1. According to the book, can be used as a sub-topic of the h1</h1>
		<h3> This is an h3, designed to be a sub-topic of the h2, and so on with h4, h5 and 6</h3>
		<h2>White spaces</h2>
		<p>If I put 2 					or more spaces or break a line in a content, 
		the browser is going to treat it like just one space, like I did just now.</p>
		<h2>Paragraphs</h2>
		<p>Paragraphs are made by an opening tag with a "P" letter after its left angle bracket, putting the content of the paragraph you want to be shown on your page, and then putting a closing tag with another "P" Letter after its forward slash.</p>
		<h2>Bold and Italic</h2>
		<p>The <b>bold</b> element is made by putting a content between an openning tag and a closing tag, with the first characters of those being a <i>"b"</i>, like this: &lt;b&gt;. The <i>Italic</i> element is made the same way, but instead of putting a <i>"b"</i>, we put an <i>"i"</i> into it.</p>
		<p>The <b>bold</b> element usually contains and emphasizes keywords of a text, while the <i>italic</i> represents words that would be spoken in different manners from surrounding text if it was spoken out loud.</p>
		<h2>Superscript and subscript</h2>
		<p>Superscript is made by putting content between a closing tag and an opening tag, with the first characters of those being "sup", subscript is made the same way, but the first characters of its tags are "sub".</p> 
		<p>The superscript element contains superscript characters(or "caracteres superíndice" in portuguese) and is most commonly used to express suffixes of dates, such as 4<sup>th</sup>, or for mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power(eg:2<sup>2</sup>), while the subscript element contains subscript characters(or "caracteres sub-índice")</p>
		<H2>Line breaks</h2>
		<p>It's possible to add line breaks into a document without having to create another paragraph<br /> like I did just now, by adding the tag "&lt;br /&gt" to the code. <br> The "&lt;br&gt" tag does the same thing</p>
		<h2>Horizontal Rules</h2>
		<p>A horizontal rule is an empty element, it's made of a left angle bracket, the letters "HR", a space and a forward slash, "&lt;HR /&gt". It's used to break different sections of a web page. Like this</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Strong and emphasis</h2>
		<p> The strong element is used to indicate that a piece of text has great importance in it. Eg: "<strong>Advice:</strong> don't close the window without saving your changes". It is made by an opening tag, a closing tag, with its first characters being "strong", and a content between them. The Emphasis element is made the same way, but the first characters of the tags are "em", it is used to indicate where the <em>emphasis</em> should be placed in a group of words, like this, and, by default, it will be shown in the browser in italic.</p>
  		<h2>Quotations and the use of the cite attribute in it</h2>
		<p> There are two elements for quotations, the Blockquote and the &lt;q&gt. </p>
		<p>The &lt;blockquote&gt element is used for longer quotes, that take up an entire paragraph. It is made of an opening tag, a closing tag, with its first characters being a "blockquote" and a content.</p>
		<blockquote cite="Duckett, J. (2011). HTML e CSS: design and build websites. J. Wiley & Sons">
			<p>Browsers tend to indent the contents of the &lt;blockquote&gt element, however you should not use this element just to indent a piece of text — rather you should achieve this effect using CSS.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The &lt;q&gt element is made the same way, but the first characters of the tags will be just "q". It <q cite="www.globo.com"> is used for shorter quotes</q> that takes place within a paragraph.</p>
		<p>There's also the possibility of using the cite attribute to indicate the source of the quotation, which was made in the examples above, it will not be shown anywhere on the screen though.</p>
		<h2>Abreviation and the use of the title atribute with it</h2>
		<p>The Abbreviation element is made of an opening tag, a closing tag, with its first characters being "abbr", and a content between the tags:&lt;abbr&gt. It Tells the browser that content is an abbreviation. Eg:<abbr>HTML</abbr></p>
		<p>The title attribute can be used with the Abbreviation element to tell the abbreviation's full term. Like: <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. The full term will be highlighted if we pass the mouse over that abbreviation in the browser.</p>
		<h2>Ins and Del</h2>
		<p>The Ins element is made of an opening tag, a closing tag, with its first characters being "ins", and a content them. It is used to indicate the insertion of a content on the page. It will be shown with an underline in it by the browser.</p>
		<p>The Del element is made the same way, with the exception that the first characters of its tags will be "del". It is used to indicate the deletion of a content from the document. It usually will appear with a line on the topside of its letters in the browser</p>
		<p>Eg: "Jon is a <del>good</del> <ins>bad</ins> lawyer."</p>
