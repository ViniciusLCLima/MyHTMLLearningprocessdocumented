		<h1>Text</h1>
		<h2>Headings</h2>
		<p>Headings are made by putting an H letter at the start of a tag, putting the correspondent number of the type of heading you want, then putting the heading content and then closing it with its closing tag. </p>
		<h1> This an H1, it is the greater of the h# elements </h1>
		<h2> This is an H2, it is smaller than the h1. According to the book, can be used as a sub-topic of the h1</h1>
		<h3> This is an h3, designed to be a sub-topic of the h2, and so on with h4, h5 and 6</h3>
		<h2>White spaces</h2>
		<p>If I put 2 					or more spaces or break a line in a content, 
		the browser is going to treat it like just one space, like I did just now.</p>
		<h2>Paragraphs</h2>
		<p>Paragraphs are made by an opening tag with a "P" letter after its left angle bracket, putting the content of the paragraph you want to be shown on your page, and then putting a closing tag with another "P" Letter after its forward slash.</p>
		<h2>Bold and Italic</h2>
		<p>The <b>bold</b> element is made by putting a content between an openning tag and a closing tag, with the first characters of those being a <i>"b"</i>, like this: &lt;b&gt;. The <i>Italic</i> element is made the same way, but instead of putting a <i>"b"</i>, we put an <i>"i"</i> into it.</p>
		<p>The <b>bold</b> element usually contains and emphasizes keywords of a text, while the <i>italic</i> represents words that would be spoken in different manners from surrounding text if it was spoken out loud.</p>
		<h2>Superscript and subscript</h2>
		<p>Superscript is made by putting content between a closing tag and an opening tag, with the first characters of those being "sup", subscript is made the same way, but the first characters of its tags are "sub".</p> 
		<p>The superscript element contains superscript characters(or "caracteres superíndice" in portuguese) and is most commonly used to express suffixes of dates, such as 4<sup>th</sup>, or for mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power(eg:2<sup>2</sup>), while the subscript element contains subscript characters(or "caracteres sub-índice")</p>
		<H2>Line breaks</h2>
		<p>It's possible to add line breaks into a document without having to create another paragraph<br /> like I did just now, by adding the tag "&lt;br /&gt" to the code. <br> The "&lt;br&gt" tag does the same thing</p>
		<h2>Horizontal Rules</h2>
		<p>A horizontal rule is an empty element, it's made of a left angle bracket, the letters "HR", a space and a forward slash, "&lt;HR /&gt". It's used to break different sections of a web page. Like this</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Strong and emphasis</h2>
		<p> The strong element is used to indicate that a piece of text has great importance in it. Eg: "<strong>Advice:</strong> don't close the window without saving your changes". It is made by an opening tag, a closing tag, with its first characters being "strong", and a content between them. The Emphasis element is made the same way, but the first characters of the tags are "em", it is used to indicate where the <em>emphasis</em> should be placed in a group of words, like this, and, by default, it will be shown in the browser in italic.</p>
  		<h2>Quotations and the use of the cite attribute in it</h2>
		<p> There are two elements for quotations, the Blockquote and the &lt;q&gt. </p>
		<p>The &lt;blockquote&gt element is used for longer quotes, that take up an entire paragraph. It is made of an opening tag, a closing tag, with its first characters being a "blockquote" and a content.</p>
		<blockquote cite="Jon Dockett book">
			<p>Browsers tend to indent the contents of the &lt;blockquote&gt element, however you should not use this element just to indent a piece of text — rather you should achieve this effect using CSS.</p>
